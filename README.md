# Restaurant Management System
 Restaurant Management System is a software built to handle all restaurant activities in 
an easy and safe manner. This System will give the Restaurant management power and 
flexibility to manage the entire system from a single portal. The system allows the 
manager to keep track of available tables in the system as well as the reservation of tables 
and bill generation.
